↳ Banking / Capital Markets / Wealth  
↳ AI × Data × Design × Strategy  
↳ Most of the serious machinery lives behind firewalls, audit trails,  
   &nbsp; &nbsp; and people who say ‘regulatory perimeter’ without irony.  
   &nbsp; &nbsp; This is what made it past compliance.

drwx------  private/    # prototypes that survived scrutiny
drwx------  private/    # weekend mad-scientist builds too
-rw-r--r--  README.md   # you are here
```

450+ contributions this year, mainly invisible. Banking prototypes, fintech integrations, and the occasional framework experiment to scratch a creative itch. Weekends are for nginx tuning and and things that probably don't need building. But here we are.
